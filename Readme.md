Instructions to run my program:

1) Enter the C program in the "input.txt" file and save it.

2) Run " flex code.l "

3) Run " gcc lex.yy.c "

4) Run a.exe

The program will output all the tokens of the C code present in the input file.

The program also outputs the frequency of each token at the end.

Change the C code in "input.txt" file and run a.exe to get the tokens and frequency of tokens for the new C code.
